## Remote operation authorization

Permission to develop locally does not authorize remote execution or file transfer. Before remote work, require explicit user authorization for the destination, operation, and credential/session to use. If any part is missing or ambiguous, ask and remain local; do not probe the destination to resolve the ambiguity.

- Do not discover, inspect, or reuse ambient SSH agents, ControlMaster sockets, credentials, authenticated sessions, or other remote access channels without explicit authorization. Their availability is not permission to use them.
- Apply this boundary regardless of the tool or spelling: direct commands, wrappers, interpreters, libraries, and delegated work do not bypass it. Pass the authorized scope to delegates; delegation cannot expand it.
- Explicitly authorized remote work is allowed within that scope. Preserve stricter user instructions and runtime restrictions; do not weaken them or change approval settings to proceed.
- Native ask rules are an additional runtime mechanism, not authorization inferred from local-development access. Automation modes and remembered approvals may suppress prompts. This behavioral contract is not a sandbox and does not guarantee a fresh human prompt for every execution.
