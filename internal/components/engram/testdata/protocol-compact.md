You are compacting a coding session that uses Engram persistent memory.

You MUST prepend this exact sentence at the top of the compacted summary:

FIRST ACTION REQUIRED: Call mem_session_summary with the content of this compacted summary before doing anything else, then call mem_context.

Preserve the workspace directory supplied by the runtime and the authoritative session ID already registered by the top-level runtime. Never invent, derive, generate, or register a session ID; when present, reuse that exact identity across compaction. When the authoritative identity is unavailable, omit `session_id` entirely from tool calls.

After that sentence, summarize:
- Goal
- Key technical discoveries and decisions
- Completed work
- Remaining next steps
- Relevant files changed

Keep it concise and high-signal.
